--------------------------------

0. Frame: [?x???? int64] - ???

1. WCin: [1×45000 logical] - binary value, 1 if the wasp's center of mass is in view, 0 if not.

2. WHin: [1×45000 logical] - binary value, 0 if the wasp's head is in view, 0 if not.

3. Fdis: [1×44995 double] - fly velocity (pixel change over 5 frames)

4. FdisF: [1×44995 double] - fly FORWARD velocity (pixel change in forward/backwards axis over 5 frames; positive if forward, negative if backwards)

5. FdisL: [1×44995 double] - fly LATERAL velocity (pixel change along lateral axis over 5 frames; used absolute value, so always positive values)

6. Wdis: [1×44995 double] - wasp velocity

7. WdisF: [1×44995 double] - wasp FORWARD velocity

8. WdisL: [1×44995 double] - wasp LATERAL velocity

9. Fangle: [1×44995 double] - fly angular change (angular change over 5 frames; used absolute value)

10. Wangle: [1×44995 double] - wasp angular change (angular change over 5 frames; used absolute value)

11. F2Wdis: [1×45000 double] - distance between fly and wasp (in terms of center of mass, in pixels)

12. F2Wdis_rate: [?×??? double] - ???

13. F2Wangle: [1×45000 double] - angle between fly's heading and wasp (0 = looking straight at wasp, 90 = perpindicular to wasp, 180 = look directly away from wasp)

14. W2Fangle: [1×45000 double] - angle between wasp's heading and fly

15. ANTdis_1: [??? double] - ???

16. ANTdis_2: [??? double] - ???

17. F2W_blob_dis: [1×45000 double] - distance between fly and wasp (in terms of the nearest edge of their body, in pixels. Will be 0 if their body's are overlapping)

18. bp_F_delta: [1×44995 double] - fly BODY pixel change (expressed as the fraction of total pixels; I forget the details of how I calculated this, but 0 = no change, >1 = big change)

19. bp_W_delta: [1×44995 double] - wasp BODY pixel change

20. ap_F_delta: [1×44995 double] - fly APPENDAGE pixel change

21. ap_W_delta: [1×44995 double] - wasp APPENDAGE pixel change

22. ant_W_delta: [1×44995 double] - wasp ANTENNAE pixel change

23. file: [?x???? object] - ???

24. walk_backwards: [?x???? int64] - ???

25. ANTdis: [44995×2 double] - wasp antennae velocity (over 5 frames; one velocity for each antennae)

26. start_walk: [?x???? int64] - binary variable indicating whether the wasp is walking back or not, i.e. is there a 'backing' even or not (1 = backing event, 0 = not backing event)
