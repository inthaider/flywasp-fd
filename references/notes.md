GitHub Copilot: Your current workflow seems to be doing a lot in a single function, which can make it difficult to understand and maintain. Here are some suggestions to improve the modularity and readability of your code:

1. **Separate Data Loading, Preprocessing, and Saving**: Right now, your `get_rnn_data` function is responsible for deciding whether to load data, preprocess it, or load preprocessed data. Consider separating these responsibilities into different functions or classes. For example, you could have a `DataLoader` class that's responsible for loading raw or preprocessed data, a `DataPreprocessor` class that's responsible for preprocessing raw data, and a `DataSaver` class that's responsible for saving preprocessed data.

2. **Use a Pipeline for Preprocessing Steps**: Your `DataPreprocessor` class has a lot of methods for different preprocessing steps. Consider organizing these steps into a pipeline, where each step is a separate function or class. This would make your code more modular and easier to understand. You could use a library like scikit-learn's `Pipeline` for this.

3. **Use a Factory or Builder Pattern for Object Creation**: Right now, your `get_rnn_data` function is responsible for creating `DataPreprocessor` and `RNNDataPrep` objects. Consider using a factory or builder pattern to handle object creation. This would make your code more modular and easier to test.

4. **Use Dependency Injection for Configuration**: Your `DataPreprocessor` and `RNNDataPrep` classes have a lot of configuration options that are hard-coded. Consider using dependency injection to pass in these options. This would make your code more flexible and easier to test.

5. **Use a Configuration File for Workflow Control**: Right now, your `get_rnn_data` function is responsible for controlling the workflow of your program. Consider using a configuration file to specify the steps of your workflow. This would make your code more flexible and easier to maintain.

6. **Use Logging Instead of Print Statements**: Your code uses print statements to output information. Consider using a logger for this, so that the output can be easily controlled and redirected.

7. **Use Docstrings and Comments**: Your code is well-documented with docstrings and comments, which is great. Continue this practice to make your code easier to understand.

Remember, the goal of these suggestions is to make your code more modular, readable, and maintainable. It's important to strike a balance between complexity and readability, so use your judgment when deciding which suggestions to implement.

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's a high-level skeleton of how you might refactor your `RNNDataPrep` class based on the suggestions above:

```python
class DataLoader:
    def __init__(self, pickle_path):
        self.pickle_path = pickle_path

    def load_raw_data(self):
        # Implement loading raw data here
        pass

    def load_processed_data(self):
        # Implement loading processed data here
        pass

    def load_train_test_data(self):
        # Implement loading train and test data here
        pass


class DataPreprocessor:
    def __init__(self, raw_data):
        self.raw_data = raw_data

    def preprocess_data(self):
        # Implement preprocessing steps here
        pass


class DataSaver:
    def __init__(self, processed_data, train_test_data):
        self.processed_data = processed_data
        self.train_test_data = train_test_data

    def save_processed_data(self):
        # Implement saving processed data here
        pass

    def save_train_test_data(self):
        # Implement saving train and test data here
        pass


class RNNDataPrep:
    def __init__(self, data_loader, data_preprocessor, data_saver):
        self.data_loader = data_loader
        self.data_preprocessor = data_preprocessor
        self.data_saver = data_saver

    def get_rnn_data(self, load_processed, load_train_test):
        if load_train_test:
            return self.data_loader.load_train_test_data()
        elif load_processed:
            return self.data_loader.load_processed_data()
        else:
            raw_data = self.data_loader.load_raw_data()
            processed_data = self.data_preprocessor.preprocess_data(raw_data)
            self.data_saver.save_processed_data(processed_data)
            return processed_data
```

This skeleton separates the responsibilities of loading data,
preprocessing data, and saving data into different classes. The
`RNNDataPrep` class then uses these classes to get the RNN data. This
makes the code more modular and easier to understand and test. You can
fill in the methods with your existing code.

i have a few updates in my codebase. now, i have added data_loader.py and data_saver.py files with DataLoader and DataSaver classes that take care of all loading and saving cases. besides that, as i mentioned before, i'm primarily using two classes, DataPreprocesser and RNNDataPrep, in data/data_preprocessing in files preprocessing.py and rnn_data_prep.py. i've removed the loading/saving functions from these two.

Here's the docstring for my preprocessing.py -> DataPreprocessor class:

And here's the docstring for my finalized data_loader.py -> DataLoader class:
    """
    Class for loading raw/processed/train-test data from files.

    In all the methods, the loaded data is copied to the data dict to

    """

Given that I now have separate DataLoader and DataSaver classes, what should my new code workflow/structure/organization be? I'm particularly concerned about my RNNDataPrep class. 

Besides needing your overall best-practices advice, i also have specific confusions. 

in DataPreprocessor, should i even have the high level get_preprocessed_data? Basically, for now at least, we have a specific workflow for data preprocessing. I could write all this code in my main.py file or the jupyter notebook where i'm doing my exploration, but it's a lot of code that i have to have manually and i feel like the orchestrating script shouldn't be handling so much (especially since there are other things it's doing too). so what should i do? what are the best practices? should i refactor my codebase differently to accommodate/rearrange this? if yes, how? or should i leave this as is?

for my RNNDataPrep class, i was thinking i should give the user two
options of which they can pick one. (1) they provide the preprocessed
dataframe as input to the constructor and use RNNDataPrep to further
process and prepare the RNN train/test splits from that df. (2) they
provide the path to already prepared/existing train/test splits/data and
RNNDataPrep loads and outputs those as they are. now, how do i handle
this option selection considering that either option then
necessitates/needs different kinds of other information as class
attributes. e.g. in the first case, the object needs to get the df
itself. in the second case, the object needs to get the path to the
existing train/test data. how is this sort of thing handled according to
best practices and the most optimal/refined programming
methodologies?AND, in fact, from the POV of best programming, ML, and
deep learning practices and workflows, should i simply have the user
directly use DataLoader to load the existing train/test data, or is it
better to have that done via an RNNDataPrep instantiation? what do the
best/leading API's and API creators/programmers/developers do? What
would you do if you were world-renowened, leading expert in software
development, programming, data science, deep learning, and MLOps?

GitHub Copilot: You can use a project root-relative path strategy. This means that all paths in your project are defined relative to the root directory of your project. This way, no matter where your scripts are run from, they will always correctly locate your files.

Here's how you can implement this:

1. Create a `config.py` file in your project root directory. In this file, define a variable `PROJECT_ROOT` that points to the root directory of your project. You can use the `pathlib` library to do this:

```python
from pathlib import Path

PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
```

2. In your other scripts, import `PROJECT_ROOT` from `config.py` and use it to define your file paths:

```python
from config import PROJECT_ROOT

data_dir = PROJECT_ROOT / 'data'
```

This way, `data_dir` will always point to the correct location, no matter where your script is run from.

Remember to add `config.py` to your version control system so that your
friend can also use it.
