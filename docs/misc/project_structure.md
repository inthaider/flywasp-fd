### Optimal Project Structure for Machine Learning/Deep Learning Projects

When structuring your project, the goal is to make it scalable, easy to understand, and simple to pick up for other data scientists, engineers, or even yourself in the future. The directory structure I'm suggesting below is based on best practices and should serve as a good starting point.

#### Directory Tree

```plaintext
Fly-Wasp-Interaction-Prediction/
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── requirements.txt
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   ├── processed/
│   └── interim/
├── notebooks/
│   ├── EDA.ipynb
│   └── Model_Experimentation.ipynb
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── data_preprocessing/
│   │   └── preprocess.py
│   ├── feature_engineering/
│   │   └── features.py
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── rnn_model.py
│   │   └── baseline_models.py
│   └── utils/
│       └── utils.py
├── config/
│   └── config.yaml
└── main.py
```

#### File and Folder Descriptions

- **README.md**: Contains an overview of the project, how to set it up, and other documentation.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git (e.g., data files, temporary files).

- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the Python packages required for the project.

- **data/**: This folder contains all the data used in the project.
  - **raw/**: Store the original, immutable data files.
  - **processed/**: Store the cleaned and preprocessed data.
  - **interim/**: Store any interim data that sits between the raw and processed stages.

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.
  - **EDA.ipynb**: For exploratory data analysis.
  - **Model_Experimentation.ipynb**: For initial model testing and experimentation.

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the project.
  - **__init__.py**: Makes the folder a Python package for easy imports.
  - **data_preprocessing/preprocess.py**: Functions to clean and preprocess the data.
  - **feature_engineering/features.py**: Code for feature extraction and engineering.
  - **models/**: Contains various models.
    - **__init__.py**: To make the models folder a Python package.
    - **rnn_model.py**: RNN model implementation.
    - **baseline_models.py**: Baseline models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
  - **utils/utils.py**: Utility functions like data loaders or custom loss functions.

- **config/**: Configuration files, such as YAML or JSON files.
  - **config.yaml**: Store all static variables, parameters, and configurations.

- **main.py**: The main script to run the project pipeline (from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation).

### Additional Tips

1. **Version Control**: Use Git for version control right from the start.

2. **Virtual Environment**: Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

3. **Code Reviews**: Even if you're working alone, reviewing your code as if someone else would look at it often leads to better code quality.

4. **Modularity and Functions**: Aim for DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code. If you find yourself repeating code, consider making it into a function.

5. **Testing**: Write unit tests for your functions to make sure they're performing as expected. This is particularly important for data preprocessing steps.

6. **Documentation**: Document your code, functions, and especially why certain decisions were made (e.g., why you chose a particular sequence length for the RNN).

7. **Experiment Tracking**: Use tools like MLflow, TensorBoard, or a simple spreadsheet to keep track of various experiments, their configurations, and results.

8. **Licensing**: If this project is going to be open-source, include a license file.

By following these best practices from the get-go, you'll set yourself up for a successful project that's easy to manage, understand, and scale.
